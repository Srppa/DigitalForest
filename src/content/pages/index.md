A rapidly growing body of research shows that spending time in a forest environment, also known as forest bathing or shinrin-yoku (森林浴), benefits health and well-being. Several systematic reviews based on dozens of studies have reported that forest bathing improves psychophysical stress.

Unfortunately, there are groups of people who are unable to visit on their own. Many people suffer from physical or cognitive disabilities limiting their free mobility and the elderly population can often feel unfit to travel far or take a walk on uneven ground. Moreover, accessing the forest can be a challenge even for physically fit people. Modern urbanization created places cut away from nature by the city sprawls from which the travel to an uncorrupted natural space can take a few hours.
